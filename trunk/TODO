  * make boost::variant play nice with json_traits so that we can have
    parameterized support for JSON

    -- right now we just hack it using a "function" flag in the axis, it should
      actually resolve to some sort of predicate, so that the user can implement

  * clean up the various query functions so that they do the right thing without
    all of the full for "(T*)0" for filtering on type; possibly an "as"
    metafunction?
  * finish and revamp description of concepts

VPATH
  * finish formal support for node(), test(), etc.
    -- right now we just hack it using a "function" flag in the axis, it should
      actually resolve to some sort of predicate, so that the user can implement

  * clean up the various query functions so that they do the right thing without
    all of the full for "(T*)0" for filtering on type; possibly an "as"
    metafunction?

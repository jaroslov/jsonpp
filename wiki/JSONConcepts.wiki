#JSONpp Concepts

= Concepts =

The JSONpp class `push_parser` is parametrized on the JSON type family provided by the user. The JSON type family is a single type function (metafunction) with the following properites:

||*Associated Type*||*Meaning*||
||----||----||
||`value_t`||The actual JSON type which can hold any JSON type||
||`string_t`||Represents a JSON string||
||`number_t`||Represents a JSON number||
||`object_t`||Represents a JSON object||
||`array_t`||Represents a JSON array||
||`bool_t`||A type which represents the JSON identifier `true` and `false||
||`null_t`||Represents a JSON array||

This means that any JSON type must have those associated types available. The way the library accesses those types is through the `json_traits` traits class, which expects those types from the underlying type, and provides associated types of those meaning.

Each of the JSON sub types must satisfy certain properties in order to be used with the `push_parser` class.

The following identifiers will be used
  * `V` : `value_t` _some value_

#summary JSONpp TODO list

= TODO =
  * _finished_ add iomanipulator support for printing
  * add printing support based on the iomanipulator above
  * set the following policy:
    # no matter the `CharT` type of the input stream, we always look for the encoding information and try to discover which of the 5 encodings we have in the stream
    # once we discover the encoding stream, we convert the stream (on the fly) to proper internal encoding; for UTF-8 this is natural, for the other encodings it may involve call `iconv` on a buffer-at-a-time basis (4096-char blocks); note that we have to be careful not to cut chars into pieces!
    # we always convert \uD8xx\uDCxx code-points into their UTF-8 string representation
    # we always convert \t, \r, etc. into their internal encodings as well, i.e., if the stream includes \t, we replace it with \u0009, etc.
  * on output if the representation is:
    # ASCII: dump straight out
    # UNICODE:
      # if the dump type is `char` then we dump ASCI,
      # if the type is `sizeof(char)*CHAR_BIT >= 16`, then we convert to code-points

#summary JSONpp TODO list

= TODO =
  * _finished_ add iomanipulator support for printing
  * add printing support based on the iomanipulator above
  * convert `string_t` support in the parser to UTF-8 using iconv; this means the user will give us a std::stream or std::wstream we just do what is usual; but if the user gives us a file-name we try to figure out what the encoding is, and do "the right thing"; this is going to require a refactoring of internal support
  * btw, figure out wchar_t -> unicode stuff (oy)
